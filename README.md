# [IoT-Based Water Quality Assessment System for Industrial Waste WaterHealthcare Perspective](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2022/3769965/)

**Abstract**<br>
The environment, especially water, gets polluted due to industrialization and urbanization. Pollution due to industrialization and urbanization has harmful effects on both the environment and the lives on Earth. This polluted water can cause food poisoning, diarrhea, short-term gastrointestinal problems, respiratory diseases, skin problems, and other serious health complications. In a developing country like Bangladesh, where ready-made garments sector is one of the major sources of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), most of the wastes released from the garment factories are dumped into the nearest rivers or canals. Hence, the quality of the water of these bodies become very incompatible for the living beings, and so, it has become one of the major threats to the environment and human health. In addition, the amount of fish in the rivers and canals in Bangladesh is decreasing day by day as a result of water pollution. Therefore, to save fish and other water animals and the environment, we need to monitor the quality of the water and find out the reasons for the pollution. Real-time monitoring of the quality of water is vital for controlling water pollution. Most of the approaches for controlling water pollution are mainly biological and lab-based, which takes a lot of time and resources. To address this issue, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time water quality monitoring system, integrated with a mobile application. The proposed system in this research measures some of the most important indexes of water, including the potential of hydrogen (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity, and temperature of water. The proposed system results will be very helpful in saving the environment, and thus, improving the health of living creatures on Earth.
